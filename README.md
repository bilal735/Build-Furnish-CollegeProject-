## **Introduction**

Welcome to the \"Build and Furnish\" project! This web-based application
aims to bridge the gap between skilled workers in the unorganized sector
(e.g., carpenters, plumbers, painters) and users who require their
services. Our platform provides a convenient and efficient way to find,
hire, and manage skilled workers for various tasks related to
construction and home improvement.

## **Project Overview**

The \"Build and Furnish\" project focuses on solving key challenges
faced by both skilled workers and users:

-   Lack of Visibility and Access to Opportunities: Skilled workers
    often struggle to find work opportunities, while users have
    difficulty discovering and connecting with qualified professionals.

-   Inefficient Job Matching Process: Users face challenges in finding
    the right workers for their specific needs, resulting in
    time-consuming and inefficient hiring processes.

-   Trust and Reliability: Establishing trust between workers and users
    can be challenging, as can determining the reliability and quality
    of work provided.

-   Limited Professional Growth Opportunities: Skilled workers may lack
    access to resources and opportunities for professional growth.

This project aims to address these challenges by providing a
comprehensive platform that streamlines the hiring process, establishes
trust, and offers secure payment methods.

## **Features**

The \"Build and Furnish\" platform offers a range of features,
including:

-   User Registration and Authentication: Create and manage user
    accounts securely.

    their skills, experience, and qualifications.

-   Job Posting: Enable users to post detailed job requirements.

-   Search and Filtering: Find workers based on location, skills,
    availability, and ratings.

-   Worker-User Matchmaking: Match users with suitable workers based on
    job requirements and worker profiles.

-   Rating and Review System: Allow users to rate and review workers
    based on their experiences.

-   Admin Panel: Manage user accounts, worker profiles, job postings,
    and overall system administration.

-   Work authentication: Allows user to authenticate worker by OTP
    verification.
